      { h: 'The challenge', p: 'Making the destruction real instead of a decal. Every blast recursively splits the plate until the hole matches the sphere, and since the plates have art on them, each fragment had to keep its own slice of the image — rotation-proof and deterministic.' },
      { h: 'How I built it', p: 'The round runs on a phase state machine that knows nothing about the game — services just register for the phases they care about, so adding the map vote was a config edit. Bomb types are pure data off the model, so a new bomb is zero code. One fall watcher handles every elimination, with kill credit, coins and stats hanging off the event it fires.

      { h: 'How I built it', p: 'The match runs on a state machine — waiting, countdown, choosing, resolving, game over — handled on the server so it can\'t be cheated. The actual fight is one small function: give it both moves and bullet counts, it spits out the damage. Each move is its own module, and the bot\'s decision-making is a separate piece I can swap out later for harder difficulty. On top of that there\'s the polish — ragdoll on death, muzzle flash, sound, a coin economy with saved data, and a shop to buy and switch guns.' },

The trick was hiding all of that behind the right abstractions so game logic never touches raw seats or physical chairs.' },
      { h: 'How I built it', p: 'The core design decisions are the interesting part: a Station layer that hides which seat is in use so chairs swap mid-game, auto-grouped arenas so duplicating a table folder "just works" with zero config, a single audited path for the IQ economy, and a folder-convention registry so adding a minigame needs no wiring edits.' },

Each attack is its own state, and combos chain by jumping to the next attack if you press again inside the combo window. Hit detection uses weapon colliders that turn on/off through animation events, so damage only happens during the actual swing. A small "already hit" list stops one swing from hitting twice. On a clean hit you get knockback, camera shake, and a hit effect. The enemy has its own state machine — it walks toward you, attacks when close, picks random attacks, and throws a projectile sometimes. The special attack slows time and desaturates the screen for a second before the projectile fires.' },
